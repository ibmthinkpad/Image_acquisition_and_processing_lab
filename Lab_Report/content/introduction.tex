we work from the lab assignment \cite{Lab_Assignments}. They state: \\

The students will work individually or in groups of two. During the lab sessions, the students are asked to develop different applications and practice what they have learned in the lessons.
The important learning aspects involve real-time embedded software development in the FreeRTOS environment, working with sensors, and developing real-time applications. Students must understand the basic concepts of multitasking, resource management and task synchronization.\\

This report describes the exercises and how they were solved by the students.
